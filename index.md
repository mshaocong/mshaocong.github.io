## Notes
I typed several notes for some class I took in the past. I am still mantaining these notes, and I will update them frequently.

### Probability and Financial Math

* [Notes on Dynamical Systems](./notes/anosovnote.pdf). This is a self-contained notes about some basic definitions and tools in dynamical systems. I checked details of some example given in Smale's paper, *Differentiable dynamical systems* (1967).  
    
* [Notes on Probability](./notes/Prob.pdf) is an entry-level probability note, including convergence of random variables, martingale theory, Markov processes, and Brownian motions.
    
* And I also write [another probability note](./notes/Prob2.pdf). It is a little bit beyond the class I took.    

* [Notes on Financial Modeling](./notes/fm/document.pdf). Pricing an option for the standard Black-Scholes model, or for the local volatility model, or for the stochastic volatility model. And modeling for bonds and defaults. 

* [Notes on Actuarial Statistics](./notes/Actuarial.pdf). These slides were made for teaching an undergraduate-level actuarial math section. In each section, I took a brief review about some fundamental concepts and went over some examples.  

### Statistics and Machine Learning

* [A basic Statistics Notes](./notes/st/document.pdf).

* [An introduction to XGboost](./notes/xgboostppt.pdf). 

* [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/mshaocong/mshaocong.github.io/tree/master/notes/sa)

## Project
I will put more details later. For now please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/mshaocong).
