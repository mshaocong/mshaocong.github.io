## Notes
I typed some notes for some class I took in the past. I am still mantaining these notes, and I will update them frequently.

* Probability and Financial Math
    * [Notes on Dynamical Systems](./notes/anosovnote.pdf). This is a self-contained notes about some basic definitions and tools in dynamical systems. I checked details of some example given in Smale's paper, *Differentiable dynamical systems* (1967).  
    
    * Notes on Probability: 
    
      [This note](./notes/Prob.pdf), it is an entry-level probability note. And I also write [another note](./notes/Prob2.pdf); in this one, I recorded something beyond the class I took. For example, I was taught to check Carleman's condition for solving some moment problems; in that note, I tried to proved a moment problem using a more general method.  

    * [Notes on Financial Modeling](./notes/fm/document.pdf).

    * Notes on Actuarial Statistics [here](./notes/Actuarial.pdf)

* Statistics and Machine Learning

    * A Basic Statistical Notes [here](./notes/st/document.pdf)
