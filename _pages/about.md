## ðŸ“Š Research Interests

- **Optimization & RL Theory**: I develop robust, efficient, and scalable algorithms for reinforcement learning and large-scale optimization. I am to rigorously characterize the statistical and computational complexities inherent in these algorithms.

- **AI for Science**: I collaborated with Lawrance Livermore National Laboratory on integrating deep learning with traditional scientific computing software. I am extending this line of research to tackle non-differentiability issues in scientific world with other scientists at UMD.
