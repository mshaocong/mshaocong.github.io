Shaocong Ma is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, working under the supervision of Professor [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). He received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Utah, where he was advised by Professor [Yi Zhou](https://sites.google.com/site/yizhouhomepage/). Previously, he completed an M.A. in Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and earned his B.S. in Statistics from Sichuan University.  

Research Interests
======
 - **Efficient Optimization and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:** My research centers on the theoretical and algorithmic underpinnings of optimization, with a particular focus on (multi-agent) reinforcement learning and related machine learning paradigms. I am driven by practical challenges, ranging from large-scale data settings to dynamic, unpredictable environments, and strive to develop methods that are both data-efficient and robust. My work emphasizes rigorous theoretical guarantees, ensuring that the algorithms I create are not only high-performing in practice but also well-founded from a mathematical standpoint.
 - **Efficient Scientific Computing and Physics-Informed Machine Learning:** I am equally passionate about using machine learning to advance scientific discovery. My efforts in operator learning and neural PDE solvers aim to integrate deep learning seamlessly with established (and often non-differentiable) black-box solvers. Through this hybrid approach, I tackle complex tasks such as fluid flow prediction in out-of-distribution regimes, striving for reliable, scalable solutions that hold up under real-world conditions. Ultimately, my goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical innovation in ML and impactful applications in computational physics, engineering, and beyond.
