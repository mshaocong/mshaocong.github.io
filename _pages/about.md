Shaocong Ma is a postdoctoral researcher at [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/), working under the supervision of Professor [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). He received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Utah, where he was advised by Professor [Yi Zhou](https://sites.google.com/site/yizhouhomepage/). Previously, he completed an M.A. in Statistics at the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and earned his B.S. in Statistics at the School of Mathematics, Sichuan University.  

Research Interests
======
 - **Optimization & Reinforcement Learning Theory:** Driven by real-world challenges, my research is centered on developing efficient optimization and decision-making algorithms applied in diverse fields such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. More specifically, I prioritize creating data-efficient and environment-robust algorithms that are substantiated with theoretical guarantees.

 - **AI4Science:** I am also passionate about designing machine learning systems for scientific computing tasks, especially the physics-informed machine learning problem. My efforts in operator learning and neural PDE solvers aim to integrate deep learning seamlessly with established (and often non-differentiable) solvers, and more importantly, to maintain their efficiency and generalization ability in out-of-distribution regimes.
