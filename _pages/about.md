I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/"  class="bio">UMIACS</a>, working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/"  class="bio">Heng Huang</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the ***University of Utah***, where I was advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yizhouhomepage/"  class="bio">Yi Zhou</a>. Previously, I completed an M.A. in Statistics at the ***University of California, Santa Barbara***, and earned my B.S. in Statistics at ***Sichuan University***.

## ðŸ“Š Research Interests

- **Memory-efficient algorithms for LLM fine-tuning**: I develop and evaluate memory-efficient fine-tuning techniques (*e.g.*, LoRA and Zeroth-Order Optimization) to reduce GPU memory footprint while preserving model performance.

- **Robust Optimization & RL Theory**:  I develop scalable algorithms for reinforcement learning and large-scale optimization, focusing on robustness against uncertainties arising from dependent data and dynamic environments.

- **AI for Science**: I previously collaborated with researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to integrate deep learning with traditional scientific computing software. I am currently extending this line of research at UMD, focusing on addressing non-differentiability in scientific pipelines using modern machine learning techniques.
