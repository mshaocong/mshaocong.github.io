Research Experiences
-----
* *Postdoctoral Researcher*
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">University of Maryland</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">2024.6 - Present</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">Supervisor: Professor Heng Huang</span><br>
  The duties involve developing more efficient and robust machine learning systems, leading and mentoring several large-scale machine learning research projects, and publishing results in top-tier conferences such as ICLR.

* *Research Intern*
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">Lawrence Livermore National Security</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">2022.5 - 2022.8</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">Supervisor: Bhavya Kailkhura, James Diffenderfer</span><br>
  The duties included designing a hybrid model incorporating external black-box PDE solvers to tackle non-differentiability challenges in fluid flow predictions and rigorously evaluating the resilience of Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks in out-of-distribution scenarios, achieving performance on par with differentiable solvers.

* *Research Assistant*
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">University of Utah</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">2019.8 - 2024.5</span>
  <br><span style="font-size: smaller; color: grey;">Supervisor: Professor Yi Zhou</span><br>
  The duties included leading machine learning projects in Professor Yi Zhou's lab, designing fast and stable algorithms for large-scale machine learning and reinforcement learning, and publishing results in top conferences such as ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR, as well as top journals like JMLR.
